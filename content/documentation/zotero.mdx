title: How to declare your DARIAH publications in Zotero?
---
The DARIAH definition of a publication is a significant and durable, accessible contribution to knowledge. A publication counts as DARIAH-affiliated when

* it resulted from work in the national consortium; funded by either DARIAH-EU or your national funding for DARIAHs/ CLARIAH

* a DARIAH-affiliated tool or resource is cited in them

* it is about DARIAH/CLARIAH or

* it is written by authors affiliated to DARIAH bodies or national DARIAHs.

They may be peer reviewed publications, or they may be reports,working papers, pre-prints, major releases of training material or even substantive blog posts.

Importantly, please also include DOIs or [other Persistent Identifiers (handles, HAL IDs etc.](https://project-thor.readme.io/docs/project-glossary)) when reporting the bibliographical entries.

You also do not need to report items deposited into DARIAH-EU HAL or Zenodo collections, as these are already automatically gathered.

## DARIAH Zotero Bibliography

DARIAH maintains a [Zotero Group Library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/744474/dariah/library) in which DARIAH publications are being compiled. It is structured into collections per DARIAH member country to collect the national publications reported as part of the Unified National Reports (UNRs).

**All DARIAH publications should be added to this DARIAH Zotero library.**

Zotero comes with good documentation - [https://www.zotero.org/support/](https://www.zotero.org/support/) - so the following guidelines only highlight the specific steps on how to add DARIAH national resources to Zotero, pointing to the existing documentation where necessary.

### Log in or register to Zotero

If you already have a Zotero account, log in via [https://www.zotero.org/user/login/](https://www.zotero.org/user/login/). If it is the first time you use Zotero, you will need to create an account: [https://www.zotero.org/user/register](https://www.zotero.org/user/register).

Note that it is also possible to work with Zotero using a local client ([https://www.zotero.org/support/installation](https://www.zotero.org/support/installation)). This will allow you, for example, to install the Zotero connector in your web browser and may make the following steps easier (but it is not necessary either)!

### Join the DARIAH Zotero Group

**The DARIAH Zotero Group is available at: **[**https://www.zotero.org/groups/744474/dariah**](https://www.zotero.org/groups/744474/dariah) (you might encounter other DARIAH related Zotero groups - [https://www.zotero.org/search/type/group?q=dariah](https://www.zotero.org/search/type/group?q=dariah) - but please use the above mentioned one).

Once you are logged in, visit the DARIAH Group and click on join, this will allow you to view and **edit** the records in the group. You only need to do this once. After joining, you can find the DARIAH group library in your personal library by logging into Zotero as per the above instructions.

### Add publications to your national folder

See Zotero documentation to understand how to manually add items to the Group Library: [https://www.zotero.org/support/adding\_items\_to\_zotero#manually\_adding\_items](https://www.zotero.org/support/adding_items_to_zotero#manually_adding_items)

Go to the DARIAH Group Library: [https://www.zotero.org/groups/744474/dariah/library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/744474/dariah/library)

#### Adding publication via your browser with the Zotero connector

> "The Zotero Connector's save button is the most convenient and reliable way to add items with high-quality bibliographic metadata to your Zotero library \[in your national folder]. As you browse the web, the Zotero Connector will automatically find bibliographic information on webpages you visit and allow you to add it to Zotero with a single click."

#### Manually adding publication with identifier

It is also possible to add items manually via the DARIAH Zotero Library (i.e. without the connector).

If your resources have an Identifier - ISBN, DOI, PubMed ID, arXiv ID, or ADS Bibcode - it is really straightforward to add them to the library using this button ! This way, Zotero can also  sometimes automatically identify resources based on a URL, e.g. to a publication page such as [this](https://journals.uio.no/dhnbpub/article/view/10650).

#### Manually adding publication without identifier

It is also possible to manually add items using the following button:

If you have downloaded the client, you can also use the import functions to create a record.

#### Copying records from other libraries

Some countries - it is the case for Italy or Germany for example - are maintaining their own Zotero library. In this case, DARIAH related records can be copied directly between libraries. To do so, simply drag the selected record(s) from the source library to the target national collection of the DARIAH Group Library (adding records to a new location will not remove them from the old one). If using Zotero online, you can also copy records by selecting the records you want to transfer, clicking the "Add to collection" button \[], and then selecting your country collection.

#### Bulk imports

You can also import records in bulk, if these are stored in one of the many [bibliographic formats supported by Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/importing_standardized_formats). For this, you need to install the [Zotero desktop application](https://www.zotero.org/download/), and then click: File → "Import..." and choose "A file".

*Tip*: if you are consolidating a list of references not very well structured, you might want to use the [AnyStyle ](https://anystyle.io/)browser tool, that will help you to parse your bibliography before importing it.
